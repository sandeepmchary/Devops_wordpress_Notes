It’s better to disable the IPV6 before you update and upgrade.

Open Terminal
Enter sudo -H gedit /etc/sysctl.conf and open the configuration file and add the following lines at the end
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1 
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1 
After that run
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6 
If it reports ‘1' means you have disabled IPV6.

If it reports ‘0‘ then please follow Step 4 and Step 5.

Type command sudo sysctl -p. You will see this in terminal.
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1 
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1 
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1 
Repeat above “Step 3” and it will now report 1.
