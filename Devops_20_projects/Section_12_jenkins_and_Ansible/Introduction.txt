Scenario
    - Current Situation
        - Agile s/w deployment
        - Continous code commit
        - Package/S.W/Artifact deploy on servers
        - s/w testing/integration testing after deployment
        - Test reports get evaluated & approval for prod deploy
        - Deploy => Test ;Deploy => Test
        - Dependencies on Ops team
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem
    - In Agile SDLC there will be frequent code changes
    - manual deployment of s/w will take too much time
    - involves task assignment/ticketing/approvals
    - Different owners for Different environments
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution
    - Deployment process should be Automated
    - Notify at each step in pipeline is failed or pass
    - integrate Automation tool

Continous Delivery Process
    - jenkins (Continous integration)
    - git
    - maven
    - checkstyle(code analysis)
    - slack (Notify)
    - Nexus (Artifactory/Repository)
    - sonarqube (code analysis server)
    - Ansible (Configuration management tool)
    - Selenium (Web automation tool) windows servers
    - Tomcat server (Web server) connected to DB server
    - AWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Architecture of Continous Delivery pipeline
    - Developers commit to the local repository
    - sync with remote repository
    - when there is change in the code 
    - jenkins will detect that change and build the code
    - jenkins will fetch all the changes
    - jenkins will do code test (unit test) pass/fail Notification will be sent
    - if passes to go the next level
    - code analysis checkstyle & sonarqube Scanner
    - report will generated and reported to sonarqube server
    - sonarqube will compare with its quality gates
        - if quality gates passes goes to next step 
        - if failed fail Notification sent to Developers
    - Maven will build the code
    - Maven needs some Dependencies to build the code, it will take from Nexus Repository
        - on Nexus we create maven central repository
    - Artifact will sent to nexus repository
        - now we have versioned Artifact gone through unit test and code analysis
    - Ansible job is deploy the Artifact, download the Artifact deploy to staging server
    - if job fails ansible will rollback 
    - if we get the approval we can deploy to production server

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flow of execution
    - Login to AWS server
    - create login key
    - create security group
        - jenkins
        - Nexus
        - Sonar
    - create Ec2 with user data
        - jenkins
        - sonarqube
        - Nexus
    - jenkins post installation 
    - Nexus repository setup
        - 3 repos
    - Sonarqube post installation
    - jenkins setup
        - Build job
        - setup slack Notification
        - checkstyle code analysis job
        - setup sonarqube integration
        - sonar code analysis job
        - Artifact upload job
    - connect all jobs together with build pipeline
    - Set automatic build trigger
    - Test with git
    - create SG 
        - windows server
        - tomcat & backend servers
    - create tomcat & backend server on Ec2
    - create jenkins job to run ansible playbook
    - Deploy Artifact to staging by ansible
    - add windows node as jenkins slave
    - create job to run s/w tests from windows server
    - Deploy Artifact to production tomcat server with ansible
    - Connect all jobs with build pipeline
    - Test it by commit with github
    - cleanup
