------------------
- terraform init
- terraform plan .
- terraform apply .
- terraform destroy .
- terraform plan -out out.terraform
- recommended is terraform plan -out file
- terraform apply for the above

                                            11) SUMMARY
- Spining up an instance in aws
- Open aws account
- Create IAM account
- Create terraform file and spin aws instance
- run terraform apply
- terraform plan : testing what infrastructure would be built based on the terraform file
- terraform apply: to apply the changes
- keeping the changes in out file (terraform plan -out changes.terraform)
- then apply those changes to the infrastructure ( terraform apply changes.terraform)
- terraform destroy .

                                            12) TERRAFORM VARIABLE TYPES
- you don't have to specify the type in variable but it is recommended                                            
- list of terraform variables
    - String
    - Boolean
    - Number
- ex: variable "a-string"{
    type = string
}
- variable "this is a Number"{
    type = number
}
- variable "true or false"{
    type = bool
}
- TERRAFORM complex TYPES
    - List(type)
    - Set(type)
    - Map(type)
    - Object ({<attr name>=<TYPE>,...})
    - Tuple([<Type>,....])
- List and Map 
    - List : [0,1,4,3,8]
    - Map : {"key"="value"}    
    - A list is always ordered, it'll always return 0,1,3,4,8 and not 0,1,4,3,8 
    - A "set" is like a list,but it does not keep the order you put in contains only unique values
    - A list that has [5,9,9,2] becomes [2,9,5] in a set ( when we put it in,terraform will sort it)
    - An object is like a map but each element can have a different type
        - ex: {
            firstname = "john"
            housenumber = 10
        }
    - AN tuple is like a list,but each element can have a different Type
        - ex: [0,"string",false]
    - only list and map are mostly used, and other are used periodically
    - variable types are 
        - string
        - number
        - bool
        - list
        - map
    - ex; variable "a-string"{
        default = "this is a string"
    }            
    variable "this is a list"{
        default = ["list of","strings"]
    }
    ----------------------------
    - Terraform is not fit to do configuration management on the software on your machines. 
    Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Salt are better alternatives to do that. 
    Terraform can work together with these tools to provide you CI on your machines. 
    Terraform provides Configuration Management on an infrastructure level, 
    not on the level of software of your machines.
