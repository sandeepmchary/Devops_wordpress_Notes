- kubernetes created by google
- in 2003 with name borg
- in 2014 to Linux Foundation
- Linux Foundation has a sub Foundation called Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- Launched in 2015 as kubernetes with open source
- now the version of kubernetes is 1.23 as per 2022-03-16
- CKA Certified kubernetes admin exam conducted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation with $300

- components are
    - APi server
    - Scheduler
    - controller
    - ETCD database
    - kube proxy
    - kubelet
    - container -- mostly used for docker
    - pod


- if i need to talk with cluster then i need to talk with APi server first
- we can also change the places of components like Scheduler, controller, etcd in different nodes
- in most cases etcd is running on one node and rest of the components are running on other nodes
- suppose we have 2 worker nodes
    - every worker node has 
        - kube proxy 
        - kubelet
        - container (rocket or docker)
    - every container is inside of a pod
    - every components will talk to each other using APi server
    - APi server will talk to kubelet and kube proxy
- # kubectl run web-server --image=nginx --port=80
- The request flow is like
    - a request is sent to APi server
    - Api server to Scheduler
    - Scheduler job is to assign a any node
    - first it will create a pod then a container is created
    - Scheduler inform kubelet about the pod
    - this info is also passed with apiserver to kubelet
    - now it's kubelet turn to create a pod
    - but the container creation job is for container(docker)
    - kubelet informs docker to create a container
    - now docker will pull nginx image from the hub or private repo
    - kubelet confirms the container creation to Scheduler with apiserver
    - kube proxy work is deal with pod network related work
    - kube proxy will create a pod network and inform Scheduler about the pod
    - with the pod information kubelet will create a container
    - kube proxy will provide ip address then informs to Scheduler
    - then Scheduler informs to database through apiserver
    - now the info is also shared with controller
    - now it's controller time to make the pod run continuously
    - when a pod is deleted then controller re creates it as per the state mentioned in the kube file
