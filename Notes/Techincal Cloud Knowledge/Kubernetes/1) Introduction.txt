- Difference between kubernetes and docker swarm
	- components like 
		- api server
		- scheduler
		- database
		- controller
	- in Docker swarm these are present in the os level 
	- if any of the components fails the application loses
	
	- but in the kubernetes, these components are in the pods like api server and scheduler in one pod and database and controller on the other pod 
	- and these can be restored very quickly than compared to os level
	-  docker swarm is created by docker communities no customization can be done
	- it has taken all the hand over to docker communities
	- kubernetes is created by google
	- kubernetes has full of customization
