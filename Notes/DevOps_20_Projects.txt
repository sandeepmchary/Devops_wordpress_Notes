						- Tag Name : Name
						- Value : cert
					- review
					- confirm and request
				- under our domain name click down arrow 
					- in our domain dns we maintain a cname record
					- copy the Name
					- copy the value
					- GO TO GODADDY.COM
					- Dns
					- RECORDS
					- ADD
					- HOST* (PASTE THE NAME HERE)
					- POINTS TO * (PASTE THE VALUE HERE)

	- ABOVE LIFE CYCLE IS CALLED AGILE 
	- each iteration could be 2-4 weeks
	- Demo will be given to Emma after every iteration
	- new ideas/features we take from the emma then we inject it to the next iteration
	- DEVOPS LIFE CYCLE

3) What is Continuous Integration
	- CI is automated process in DevOps
	- centralized place like github
	- Version Control System
	- Build sever 
		- builds
		- Tested
		- Evaluated
		- we get build or Artifact this will be stored in a s/w repository
		- Archive of file of Artifact repo can be 
			- war/jar
			- DLL/MSI/EXE
			- Tar/Zip
		- then to testing s/w if everything is ok
		- then to production 
	- PROBLEM
		- coded then to build server
			- problem is 
				- Errors
				- Bugs
				- conflicts
				- build failures
			- code is merged into the repo but not intergrated
	- SOLUTION
		- for every commit their should be build & tested
		- Automate this process 
		- for every commit we build it and test it if their is any error we notify it to the Developer
		- then Developer fix the code and commit it again
	- Cyclic View 
		- CODE
		- FETCH
		- Build
		- TEST
		- NOTIFY
		- FEEDBACK AND CODE,..,...,..
	- this is automation or CI
	- Goal of CI is to detect defects at early stage 
	
	- Build Tools
		- maven,ant,gradle
		- msbuild,visual build
		- IBM urban code
		- Make
		- Grunt
	- S/W Repositories
		- SONATYPE NEXUS
		- JFROG ARTIFACTORY
		- ArchivA
		- CLOUDSMITH PACKAGE
		- GRUNT
	- CI Tools
		- JENKINS
		- CIRCLECI
		- TEAMCITY
		- BAMBOO CI
		- CRUISE CONTROL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) 004 What is Continuous Delivery
	- Deployment
		- Server provsioning
		- Dependencies
		- conf changes
		- n/w
		- Artifactory Deployment
	- There are lot automation tools
		- ansible,puppet,chef for system automation
		- terraform,cloudformation for cloud infrastucture automation
		- jenkins,octopus deploy for ci/cd automation
		- helm charts
		- code deploy
	- Test Automation
		- Functional 
		- load
		- performance
		- db
		- security
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
