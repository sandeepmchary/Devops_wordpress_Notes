- here we need 3 servers
- 1 has consul same as etcd (these are key value pair databases)
- 2 docker servers
- my systems are having L2 connectivity with L3 configuration 
- L2 connectivity is done using bridge
- suppose there are 2 servers how they connect with each other with different switches
- these can possible through vsln tracking (tunneling)
- here we are doing from strach without depending on overlay networking of docker swarm

process of installation of consul

# wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/1.8.3/consul_1.8.3_linux_amd64.zip
# unzip consul_1.8.3_linux_amd64.zip
- the unzipped file is a binary so it needs to move /usr/local/bin/
# mv consul /usr/local/bin/
