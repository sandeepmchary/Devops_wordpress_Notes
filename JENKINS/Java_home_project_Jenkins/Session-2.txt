1. What is Master Slave in Jenkins

jenkins master slave architecture
    - to master we can add slaves
    - docker
    - cloud
why we need jenkins master 
    - scale jenkins
    - different slave with different env

2. Jenkins configure Linux Slave

    - 1 jenkins master & Linux slave
    - manage jenkins
    - manage nodes & clouds
    - new node
            - Node Name: Linux slave
                - select parmanent agent
                # of executers: [depends upon how much cpu memories core of slave]
                Remote root directory: /opt/jenkins/
                Labels: linux-one ( to tie a job to run on the slave)
                usage: only build job with label expression matching the node
                launch method: launch agents via ssh
                    - Host: {private ip of the slave}
                      credentials: 
                            add jenkins:
                                - kind: ssh username with private key
                                ID: linux-slave-new
                                Description: linux
                                username:
                                private key:paste the pem file here
                            add
                    host key verification: non verifying verification strategy
                    Avaliblity: keep this agent online as much as possible
    - on the slave server make sure the directory /opt/jenkins is present
    - inside the slave 
        - cd /opt
        - ls
        - mkdir jenkins
        - jenkins should have permission with ec2-user
        - in the slave configure our master connects to the slave using ec2-user
        - the same user must have permission to the jenkins folder
        - java is installed
