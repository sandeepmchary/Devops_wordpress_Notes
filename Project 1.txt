Login to jenkins server
check for the "maven plugins" in pluguins install it without restart
hello-world name of the project

Make sure that git is installed in the jenkins server
paste the link into the git link https://github.com/sandeepmchary/hello-world-master.git




Under Build 
-------------
Root POM is POM.xml
Goals and options : clean install package

now apply and save 

run the build now options
the archived file .war file will stored in the /var/lib/jenklins/workspace/hello-world/webapp/target/webapp.war

The above can shown under in the build success 

---- Make sure tomcat is up and running in the another server  ---
in jenkis server 

go to credentials 

select jenkins

global credentials

add credentials

for deploying a war files through jenkins the user must have manager-script role 
give id and password 

id deployer

passwdd deployer

save

in Jenkins server under post build actions

add post build actions -- we cannot find any option to deploy any war or ear file option for that we need to install $$ Deploy to Container $$

after installing $$ Deploy to Container $$ we will get Deploy war or ear to a container option is shown in the post build options

( post build => Deploy war or ear to container)

war /ear files : < we need to provide the path > (**/*.war) or (/var/lib/jenklins/workspace/hello-world/webapp/target/webapp.war) as per in this case only
containers => tomcat 8 => provide credentials and tomcat url 

save and apply

Then it will be shown on the tomcat server 

In jenkins server go to 

Build Triggers => select POLL SCM => */2 * * * * 

if we change the any thing in the github the same will be updated in the jenkins server with in 2 minutes

Simple DevOps Project -01
We know how to use work with each and Git, Jenkins independently. What if you want to collaborate these two? that is where Simple DevOps project helps you. Follow below steps if you are a new guy to DevOps. You love it.

Prerequisites
EC2 instance with tomcat installation **installation steps video
Jenkins server **Get Help here
Part-01 : Adding steps for Integration
Steps to create Jenkin job
Login to Jenkins console
Create Jenkins job, Fill the following details,
Source Code Management:
Repository: https://github.com/ValaxyTech/hello-world.git
Branches to build : */master
Build:
Root POM:pom.xml
Goals and options : clean install package
Part-02: Adding Deployment Steps
in this port we are going to install 'deploy to container' plugin. this is need to deploy on tomcat server which we are using.

Install maven plugin without restart
Manage Jenkins > Jenkins Plugins > available > deploy to container
To deploy our build artifacts on tomcat server our Jenkins server need access. For this we should setup credentials. This option is available in Jenkins home page

setup credentials
credentials > jenkins > Global credentials > add credentials
Username	: deployer
Password : XXXXXXX
id : Tomcat_user
Description: Tomcat user to deploy on tomcat server
Modify the same job which created in part-01 and add deployment steps.

Post Steps
Deploy war/ear to container
WAR/EAR files : **/*.war
Containers : Tomcat 8.x
Credentials: Tomcat_user (which created in above step)
Tomcat URL : http://<PUBLIC_IP>:<PORT_NO>
Save and run the job now.

Port-03 : Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Now job is running fine but to make this as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Tod do that go back and modify job as below.

Build Triggers
Poll SCM
schedule */2 * * * *
Save the job and modify the code in GitHub. Then you could see your job get trigger a build without any manual intervention.
